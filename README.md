### Data Manipulation and Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates data manipulation and analysis tasks using the numpy and pandas libraries in Python.

## Introduction
This notebook showcases various data manipulation and analysis operations using numpy and pandas libraries. The code provides examples of creating a DataFrame, accessing specific columns and rows, performing calculations, filtering rows based on conditions, and sorting the DataFrame.

## Code Description
The code is organized into several sections, each focusing on a specific data manipulation or analysis task. The main sections include:

1. Importing the required libraries: This section imports the numpy and pandas libraries, which are essential for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

2. Creating a numpy array and converting it to a DataFrame: This section demonstrates how to create a numpy array and convert it into a pandas DataFrame. The array contains numerical values that serve as the basis for further analysis.

3. Accessing columns and rows: This section showcases how to access specific columns and rows within the DataFrame. It provides examples of accessing a specific column and extracting its values, as well as accessing a specific row and retrieving its contents.

4. Performing calculations: This section illustrates how to perform calculations on the DataFrame. It includes examples of calculating the sum of values in a column and calculating the mean of each row.

5. Filtering rows based on condition: This section demonstrates how to filter rows based on a specific condition. It shows how to retain only those rows where a certain column meets a particular criterion.

6. Sorting the DataFrame: This section showcases how to sort the DataFrame based on a specific column. It provides an example of sorting the DataFrame in descending order based on column 'B'.

## Usage
To run the code and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.x and the required libraries (numpy and pandas) on your local machine.

2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file, "Data_Manipulation_and_Analysis.ipynb", using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.

4. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to observe the output and understand the various data manipulation and analysis operations.

## Results
The code provides insights into different data manipulation and analysis tasks. By running the notebook, you can see the following results:

* The DataFrame containing the provided numpy array is displayed.
* Specific columns and rows are accessed and their contents are printed.
* Calculations such as column sum and row mean are performed and the results are displayed.
* A filtered DataFrame is generated based on a condition and printed.
* The DataFrame is sorted based on a specific column in descending order and the sorted DataFrame is displayed.
